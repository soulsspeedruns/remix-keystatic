title: "Cave Skip"
---

The **Cave Skip** is a skip in [Bloodborne](/bloodborne) allowing the player to skip the cave to the poison lake in order to reach Iosefkaâ€™s Clinic faster.

The skip is located near the 3 Beast Blood Pellets guarded by a Large Huntsman. To perform the skip, run across the gravestones and jump out of bounds. When you are out of bounds, go up to the left until you reach a wall. Drop down on the graves and roll away into the poison lake.
