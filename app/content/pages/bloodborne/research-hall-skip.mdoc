title: "Research Hall Skip"
---

The **Research Hall Skip** is a skip in [Bloodborne](/bloodborne) that allows you to skip a portion of the Research Hall in order to reach the Living Failures boss fight faster.

The skip is located on the top of the rafters on the far right of the Research Hall. The character falls on top of a beam then can use various methods to land on a non-visible platform with collision.

In the slower version, the player jumps to an invisible ledge then platforms down until at the Living Failures door.

In the faster version, the player jumps to a different invisible ledge, then rolls through until inside the Living Failures arena. This method also can bypass the boss trigger, leaving the first Failure unresponsive even when taking damage. Its health is still tied to overall health pool, but currently to continue the fight the boss trigger must be activated.
