title: "Fall Control Quitout"
---

The sorcery [Fall Control](//darksouls.wikidot.com/fall-control) in [Dark Souls](/dark-souls) can be abused to survive almost any drop in the game which would normally only kill you on impact. To perform this, cast Fall Control, take the drop, and [Save & Quit](/save-and-quit) just as your character hits the ground. If the timing was correct, your character will load at where your drop quitout was. Note that this only works on solid surfaces, moving platforms like elevators do not save your position and as such you cannot use this glitch on them. Fall Control Quitouts were discovered by Fed981 in December 2014.
