title: "100%"
---

**[Dark Souls](/dark-souls) 100%** is a speedrun category in which the player tries to complete the game as fast as possible while also fully clearing the game world. Glitches, skips and sequence breaks are all allowed. Using other programs to affect the game or editing the game code is not allowed; apart from a few exceptions allowed by the community.

The leaderboards for this category are available [here](//speedsouls.com/leaderboards/darksouls/100).

## Objectives

The objective is 100% world completion, meaning all permanent and significant interactions/goals in each area need to be performed/accomplished.

- Clearing all 26 bosses
- Clearing all non-respawning enemies**(1)**
- Unlocking all shortcuts and locked doors**(2)**
- Revealing all illusory walls**(3)**
- Dissolving all foggates
- Unlocking all warp points and kindling all 43 bonfires to the furthest level**(4)**
- Clearing all treasure locations**(5)**
- Finishing all NPC questlines**(6)**

**(1)** All of them need to be cleared when you finish the game. Any means are allowed here as long as the entities don't exist in the area anymore, for example the Gargoyles in Anor Londo can be cleared by turning Anor Londo to dark instead of killing them if desired. Black Phantom NPCs can be cleared by simply clearing the boss of the area, but some of them need to be killed separately in order to access all of the collectibles (for example Kirk's or Leeroy's set).

**(6)** Generally, any NPC moving from one place to another or any NPC appearing/disappearing is considered a questline. The final state of each NPC questline (last location/disappeared/appeared) has to be reached where the NPC has to then be killed when hollow as they now fall under the 2nd rule (clearing all non-respawning enemies). Premature killing does not count as a completed questline.

| List of all NPC questlines |
| -------------------------- |

| \* Anastacia + Lautrec: Free Lautrec, let him kill Anastacia, then kill Lautrec in Anor Londo and revive Anastacia in Firelink afterwards.

- Ciaran: Make her disappear by giving her Artorias' Soul.
- Crestfallen Warrior: Trigger his dialogues to make him go hollow, then kill him in New Londo Ruins.
- Domhnall: Make him move to the Firelink aqueduct by ringing both Bells of Awakening.
- Dusk: Rescue Dusk from Manus.
- Griggs: Free him in Undead Burg, buy all his spells to make him go hollow, then kill him in Sen's Fortress.
- Ingward: Make him move to Firelink by talking to him before and after killing Four Kings.
- Laurentius: Free him in the Depths, show him a chaos pyromancy to make him go hollow, then kill him in Blighttown
- Logan: Free him in Sen's, make him go hollow in the Duke's Archives by buying all his spells, then kill him at the first Seath encounter arena.
- Oswald: Make him appear by ringing the Church bell.
- Patches: Make him move to Firelink.
- Quelaana: Has to be gone from Blighttown by the end of the run. This may be achieved by simply ignoring her but if you do use her services you have to buy all her spells, get an ascended pyromancy flame and kill Bed of Chaos to make her leave.
- Rhea: Rescue her in the Tomb, buy all her miracles to make her go hollow, then kill her in Duke's Archives.
- Shiva: Join the Forest Covenant to make him appear. After that him being in Darkroot or in Blighttown are both equally valid final states as they are non-permanent based on your covenant.
- Siegmeyer + Sieglinde: Help Siegmeyer in Sen's, Anor Londo, Blighttown, Izalith and talk to Sieglinde in Firelink to make them move to Ash Lake.
- Solaire: Talk to him throughout Lordran to make him go hollow or save him. Kill him in Izalith if hollowed, talk to him in Izalith if saved.
- Sif (DLC): Free him from the Humanity sprites. |
