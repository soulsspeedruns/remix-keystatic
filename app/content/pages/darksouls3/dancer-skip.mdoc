title: "darksouls3:Dancer Skip"
---

The **Dancer Skip** is a skip in **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** in which the player uses the **[darksouls3:TearDrop](/darksouls3/teardrop)** glitch to skip the **Dancer of the Boreal Valley** fight.

- The skip is only used in the **[darksouls3:Any%](/darksouls3/any)** category.
- The skip is _only possible in sequence_ by initiating the Dancer fight early by killing **[Emma](//darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Emma)**, then executing **[darksouls3:Doll_Skip](/darksouls3/doll-skip)** to Aldrich, killing/cheesing him and proceeding by getting _teleported back to the Dancer Fog Gate_ before the boss room whilst being the **[darksouls3:TearDrop](/darksouls3/teardrop)** state.
- This skip `only works on Patch 1.04` since the **[darksouls3:TearDrop](/darksouls3/teardrop)** glitch has been patched.
