The **Vilhelm Skip** is a skip in the **Ashes of Ariandel** DLC of **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** in which the player drops down into a **Deathcam** using the **[darksouls3:Crow_Quills_Glitch](/darksouls3/crow-quills-glitch)** or a **Plunge Attack Fall Damage Cancel**,\
proceeding by going back up on the branches, ending up at the other side of the Wooden door in the Church where Friede resides due to the _Church Front Door_ not loading in.

- Vilhelm Skip skips having to fight **Sir Vilhelm** and skips having to go all the way over the snowy mountain into the crypt of bugs to open the wooden door to Friede's Chapel.
- Time saved performing this skip: `60 - 90 seconds`
- The initial skip was found by **[PeachyMike](//youtube.com/channel/UCr2ZxaDmvfzIOr_5PE20EEA)** and was later further developed by **[Distortion2](//twitch.tv/distortion2)**. Later **[Distortion2](//twitch.tv/distortion2)** found a method to perform it on **Current Patch**.
- The skip was found on `Patch 1.08` and was patched in `Patch 1.09` , but made its return on later patches using **plunge attack fall damage cancels**
