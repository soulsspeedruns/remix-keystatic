This page is meant to provide information on the speedrunning strategies for fighting **Dragonslayer Armour** in **[Dark_Souls_III](/dark-souls-iii)**. The strategies on this page can be applied to any leaderboard category of the game.\
**NOTE**: Strategies might vary if the weapon or upgrade level used in another category is different than what is shown in the video examples here. The general concept of the respective strategy should still be similar either way.

## General information

- **DSA** staggers on the **14th hit** by any weapon with the same poise damage as the _Sellsword Twinblades_, on any patch where this weapon is currently used for speedruns. This can be used to very quickly finish him off before the butterflies in the second phase begin attacking, due to additional counter damage being taken during the stagger.
- What is referred to as **turtling** by many runners may in many cases be stopped by hitting the shield when **DSA** is blocking, where he will instead start attacking you.
- Many of the attacks **DSA** does can be baited out based on your positioning in reference to his. Learning how to effectively bait the better attacks out while also getting damage in yourself is a crucial part of executing the fight safely, quickly and consistently.
- One highly recommended tool in learning this boss is to turn off all damage, and just fight the boss for a long time, figuring out the limits to what you can do when it comes to strafing, baiting attacks, how many hits you can get in etc.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <http:///File:DSA_Opener_-_Shield_backslam_into_horizontal_.mp4> |

*Make sure to roughly get behind his left leg for the opener, then get 1-2 hits in, depending on the speed of the opener he gave.*After that, strafe the shield backslam by walking past his left side, then get another 3 hits in while staying behind/to the side of his right leg.\
After that, he should do a slow horizontal swing, which will let you again strafe behind him and then get an additional 3-4 hits in (4 in the case you only got 1 at the start, 3 in case you got 2 at the start).\*\*

| <http:///File:DSA_Backstep_into_shield_bash_(sprint).mp4> |

| -------------------------------------------- |

| <http:///File:DSA_Transition_swipe_roll_into_bait.mp4> |

|                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| <http:///File:DSA_Transition_swipe_strafe_into_bait.mp4> |

_How to typically deal with him turtling - hit the shield, then most of the time he will do this shield bash. Roll to his left, then bait the shield backslam._
