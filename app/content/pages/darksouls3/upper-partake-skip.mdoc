The **Upper Partake Skip** is a skip in **The Ringed City DLC** from **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** which lets the player skip the majority of _The Ringed City_ by abusing a specific _grab attack_ of the Locust Preacher acting as an NPC to clip OoB through a staircase close to the start of The Ringed City.

- The initial skip was found by **[Distortion2](//twitch.tv/distortion2)**.
- Time saved performing the skip: `Over 60 seconds`
- This Partake Skip is labeled **Upper Partake Skip** because geographically the skip is executed in the upper part of The Ringed City. The founder of this skip first found: **[darksouls3:Lower_Partake_Skip](/darksouls3/lower-partake-skip)**
- The skip is confirmed to work on `Patch 1.12` but was later patched in `Patch 1.15`
- The initial method that lead to the discovery of this skip using **Frame Buffering / Skipping** is currently **banned** in Speedruns because of hardware limitations.
