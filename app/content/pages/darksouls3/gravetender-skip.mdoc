The **Gravetender Skip** is a skip in **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** in the _Ashes of Ariandel DLC_ which allows the player to perform a **[darksouls3:Spook_Quitouts](/darksouls3/spook-quitouts)** on an invisible platform past the sewer in _Corvian Settlement_ to access the Champion Gravetender bossfight earlier then intended.

- Gravetender Skip skips the entire sequence of dropping down on the big branches before the church of Ariandel.
- Time saved performing this skip: `35 seconds`
