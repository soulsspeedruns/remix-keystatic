title: "darksouls3:Watchers Glitch"
---

The **Watchers Glitch** is a glitch in **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** in which the player is able to bypass a trigger past the _Fog Gate_ of **Abyss Watchers** which normally causes the Boss to attack the player, by performing a few specific movements in sequence inside the boss room, causing Abyss Watchers to fully freeze.

- The Abyss Watchers do not attack you at all when executing this glitch. Even not in **Phase 2**. The cutscene will play, but even after the cutscene the AI remains frozen.
- The initial glitch was discovered by **[Weskerrun](//youtube.com/channel/UCMheSnhQp_3c7EFcGUdl7mA)** and later further developed by **[Distortion2](//twitch.tv/distortion2)**
- The glitch `only works on Patch 1.05 and later versions.`
- This glitch serves as successor for another glitch found on a earlier game version but using a similar method namely: **[darksouls3:Cinder_Glitch](/darksouls3/cinder-glitch)**
