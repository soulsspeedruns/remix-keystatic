title: "darksouls3:Cinder Glitch"
---

The **Cinder Glitch** is a glitch in **[Dark Souls III](/dark-souls-iii)** on `Patch 1.04` in which the player is able to bypass a trigger past the _Fog Gate_ of **Soul of Cinder** which normally causes the Boss to attack the player, by performing a few specific movements in sequence inside the boss room, causing Soul of Cinder to fully freeze.

- Soul of Cinder does not attack you at all when executing this glitch. The only attack the boss will do is a pre-programmed AoE attack he does when switching from Phase 1 to Phase 2.
- The initial glitch was discovered by **[PeachyMike](//youtube.com/channel/UCr2ZxaDmvfzIOr_5PE20EEA)**
- The glitch is patched on `Patch 1.05`
- This glitch serves as predecessor for another glitch using a similar method: **[darksouls3:Watchers_Glitch](/darksouls3/watchers-glitch)**
